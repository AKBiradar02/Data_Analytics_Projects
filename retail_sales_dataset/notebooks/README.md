📊Retail Sales Performance Analysis — Insights Summary

After performing extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the retail sales dataset (1000 transactions from 2023), several key insights were discovered:

Customer Demographics:

The majority of customers are Adults (36–50 years), followed by Young Adults (26–35 years).

This indicates that middle-aged individuals form the core customer segment driving revenue.

Gender Analysis:

Both genders contribute significantly to sales, but female customers show slightly higher average spending per transaction — especially in Beauty and Clothing categories.

Product Category Performance:

Electronics leads in total revenue, accounting for the highest overall sales.

Clothing and Beauty follow closely, suggesting a balanced mix of essential and luxury spending behavior.

Monthly Sales Trend:

Sales peak during November and December, likely due to festive and holiday shopping patterns.

The lowest sales are seen in February, reflecting an off-season dip.

Age Group Spending Behavior:

Adults (36–50) spend the most, while Youth (18–25) contribute the least.

This shows a strong purchasing power among working professionals and families.

Correlation Insights:

Total Amount has a strong positive correlation with both Quantity and Price per Unit, confirming that higher product prices and bulk purchases drive overall revenue.

No significant correlation was observed between customer age and spending, implying age doesn’t directly influence transaction size.

Product Category vs Gender Dynamics:

Females dominate purchases in Beauty and Clothing, while Males are the main buyers in Electronics.

This demographic split can be leveraged for targeted marketing campaigns.

🧠 Key Business Recommendations

Focus promotions and marketing on Adults (36–50) during November–December.

Introduce loyalty programs for female customers to strengthen repeat sales in Beauty and Clothing.

Offer bundled discounts in Electronics to encourage larger quantity purchases.

Expand stock and targeted advertising during high-sales months to maximize profit.
